## Goals

The main aims of this workshop are to bring together stakeholders in the chemical and material sciences data domains to:

1. find specific case studies that promote interoperability between products/solutions,
2. align and design various technical standards (e.g., schemas and API standards) and share the development burden for community-focused tools required to carry out the case studies (automatic validators and infrastructure), and,
3. create an ongoing dialogue between interested parties in the form of online meetings, hackathons and otherwise, that will lead to white papers and collaborations that enable new science.

Several case studies from point a) are already in development between pairwise combinations of the attendees. The question to answer is whether, building on existing work, these can be made more inclusive and generic such that their reach is increased to external initiatives.
