## Timetable

Three sessions will be scheduled such that participants in Europe, North America, and Asia can easily attend at least one session per day. All times are in UTC/GMT. You can import all the events into your calendar by subscribing to [our Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/7i8i4lb012dsglucaclv8avfo8%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).

## Hacking sessions

We will also have a less structured "hacking" track for those that want to get started coding right away. For this, join the #hacking channel on Discord and/or the hacking room on Gather. 

We have [some potential problems to work on](https://github.com/MADICES/MADICES-2022/discussions/33) but welcome your suggestions.
